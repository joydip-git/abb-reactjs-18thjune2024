create a react application => pmsapp
create a component to display list of products 

a. fetch data from backend-server using axios package
note: create a file (service) with the method

b. create the component => ProductList
display image, name, price and rating of the product through a <table> element

but for every row you need to create a small component => ProductDetail
this component will return a <tr> element displaying a product object's properties 

Note: 
	create model to represent product data
	create another model to represent the response from api
	message, data => Product|Product[]|null

2nd update:
a. remove the "Load Products" button and fetch data and display when the component is rendered (use effect hook) forthe very fisrt time (and only one time in its lifecycle)

b. when the image in any row is clicked, immediately the complete product details should be displayed below the table using another component (again use effect hook to fetch data)
